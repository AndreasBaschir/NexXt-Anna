### NexXt Ana - Your Customer Service Operator Helper

![NexXt ANA Logo](logo.jpg)

**NexXt ANA's** purpose is to enhance the **Customer Satisfaction Rate (CSAT)**. It aims to achieve this through an advanced **multi-agent artificial intelligence** system that analyzes customer and operator conversations in real time and offers **personalized recommendations** for call center operators. This approach not only improves the customer experience but also significantly reduces **operational costs (OPEX)**, particularly those associated with training new employees.

## Core Functionality

1. **Transcription Agent - Google Speech Recognition**  
   - Transcribes calls between the client and operator.

2. **Summarization Agent - OpenAI GPT API**  
   - Summarizes the transcript of the conversation.

3. **Vector Database**  
   - Stores embeddings corresponding to usage guides, banking product information, and personal information that operators have access to.

4. **Retrieval Augmented Generation Chatbot (RAG) - ChromaDB, OpenAI GPT API**  
   - The RAG searches the vector database for a solution to the clientâ€™s problem, provides it to the operator, along with recommendations for approaching the issue.

5. **Streamlit GUI**  
   - A graphical interface available to the operator that displays the conversation summary with the client and bot recommendations for similar future situations.
